# RSS BOT Hackaton P3

## Requirements

Build a RSS bot that will monitor traffic on support/review tickets

The bot will be hosted on a DO droplet, you can use whatever language you want develop

Get plugins and themes from our wporg usernames ( you can test with themeisle ) 

"Store the support/review no of topics and replies and develop an algorithm to detect 
increases of support ticket and email yourself when alert is triggered."

"You need to think of an algorithm that will avoid false alerts, for instance if you build 
the detection if the no of replies/topics is above 50% of the average and the average would 
be 1 ticket per day an increase of 100% would be 2 which is not really a reason to trigger an alert. "

The checking interval would be for 1 hour.

Project will need to be on git, have a readme with a step by step tutorial on how to use it.

The code will need to be properly documented, each function/class will need to have valid docs.
